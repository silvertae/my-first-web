          Gear have their own slots in the inventory. There are four types of equippable gear: Helmets, Armor, Knockdown Shields, and Backpacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Gear</b> comes in different levels, each with a different rarity. <span style="color:#cead21; text-shadow: -1px -1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.0), 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.0), -1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.0), 1px -1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.0); font-weight:bold;">Level 4</span> gear has the same stats as <span style="color:#b237c8; font-weight:bold;">Level 3</span> gear, but they grant the player perks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Level 1 is Common.</li>
          <li>Level 2 is Rare.</li>
          <li>Level 3 is Epic.</li>
          <li>Level 4 is Legendary.</li>
          <li>Level 5 is Mythic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The game prevents players from swapping gear with gear of equal or lower level. However, players can swap armor for one of an equal or lower level if their current armor has fewer shields. Also, players can swap between the two armor types—Body Body Shield and Evo Shield—regardless of levels or shields, but they must hold if the other armor is weaker.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to equippable gear, there are also deployable gear known as Survival items.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the <b>Starter Kit</b> for Battle Royale, each Legend drops with a Level 1 Helmet, a Level 1 Evo Shield, and a Level 1 Knockdown Shield (alongside 2 Syringes and 2 Shield Cells). Level 1 Helmets and Knockdown Shields cannot be found as loot, unless a player drops them for a better Helmet or Knockdown Shield.
