  <p><b>Weapons</b> are the main method of dealing damage in Apex Legends and Apex Legends Mobile. In Battle Royale, Legends drop into the arena without any weapon equipped, and must find them from any suitable loot source upon landing. In Arenas, most weapons can be purchased before the round starts. Regardless of the game mode, up to two firearms can be carried.</p>

  <p>A weapon's effectiveness and fire power can be enhanced through attachments that can help stabilize the weapon, increase its magazine size, change its optics, and more.</p<

  All weapons are split into seven categories:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Assault rifles</b>, also stylized as <b>Assault Rifles</b> or <b>ARs</b></li>
    <li><b>Sub machine guns</b>, also stylized as <b>SMGs</b></li>
    <li><b>Light machine guns</b>, also stylized as <b>LMGs</b></li>
    <li><b>Marksman weapons</b>, also stylized as <b>Marksmen</b></li>
    <li><b>Sniper rifles</b>, also stylized as <b>Snipers</b></li>
    <li><b>Shotguns</b></li>
    <li><b>Pistols</b>.</li>
  </ul>
