  <p><strong>Legends</strong> are playable characters in Apex Legends and Apex Legends Mobile. Each Legend is a unique character with their own backstory, abilities, and playstyle. Most Legends need to be unlocked by using Legend Tokens or Apex Coins. A new Legend is released every season.</p>

  <p>Legends are categorized into classes: <strong>Offensive, Defensive, Support, and Recon</strong>. These classes can have perks that apply for all Legends of that class. Currently, there is only 1 class with a perk: Legends of the Recon class can scan Survey Beacons to find the next location of the Ring.</p>
